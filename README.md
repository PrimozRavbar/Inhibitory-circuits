The main model code for "Inhibitory circuits coordinate leg movements during Drosophila grooming" paper.
All the model functionality is in one file: Model_code.ipynb 

The code allowes users to run the model and visualize the data, includin making movies.
New model instances can be evolved.

The current model files are: solution_MS, and population_MS. The files can be loaded to the main code (Model_code.ipynb)

An example movie of the model is: Model_MS.avi
