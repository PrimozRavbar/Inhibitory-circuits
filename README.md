Durafshan Sakeena Syed, Primoz Ravbar, Julie H Simpson

Code written by Primoz Ravbar (2024) for the paper.

The contents:
- model code
- classification and dimensionality reduction code

All the model functionality is in one file: Model_code.ipynb 

This code allows users to run the model and visualize the data, including making movies.
New model instances can be evolved.

The current model files are: solution_MS, and population_MS. The files can be loaded to the main code (Model_code.ipynb)

An example movie of the model is: Model_MS.avi  This movie is referenced as Video 1 in the paper.

Behavior data analysis code:
